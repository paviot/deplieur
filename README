Installation :
==============

col2ordequivDDD needs two very specific libraries and one header from
a usually avaiable library to compile :

* C++ Boost "shared_ptr" template (http://www.boost.org/)
  Your system should have a package to install this one.
* libPetri
  ???
* libDDD (http://ddd.lip6.fr)
  This library is available with a LGPL license.

To build the tools, just type :
./configure --with-libddd-incdir=path to libDDD includes
	    --with-libddd-libdir=path to libDDD libraries
	    --with-libpnet-incdir=path to libPetri includes
	    --with-libpnet-libdir=path to libPetri libraries

If your system does not have an installed package of C++ Boost,
install it and add "--with-boost-incdir= root of Boost installation"
argument to the ./configure line.

Tools can be built using the FrameKit platform. Juste add a
"--with-framekit= root of FrameKit installation" argument to the
./configure line.

You can give "--enable-debug" and "--enable-profile" too, to enable
debug and profiling options of the compiler.
